# Huntress Blink Invulnerability
[Thunderstore page](https://thunderstore.io/c/risk-of-rain-returns/p/Klehrik/Huntress_Blink_Invulnerability/)

Makes Huntress' Blink skill give invulnerability frames (to allow for fall damage cancellation).  
I'm really not sure why this isn't in the base game.
